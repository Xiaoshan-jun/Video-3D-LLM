## üöÄ Announcing Our Latest Work!

We are excited to introduce our newest research: **Learning from Videos for 3D World: Enhancing MLLMs with 3D Vision Geometry Priors**.

This research delves into how explicitly incorporating 3D vision geometry priors can significantly advance the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding the 3D world through video inputs. We believe this approach marks a significant step forward in creating more spatially aware and robust AI systems.

‚û°Ô∏è **Discover more about this exciting new project here: [Website](https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/VG-LLM) [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24625)**

This work complements and builds upon our research in creating powerful 3D-aware models. Below, you'll find the details for our related project, **Video-3D LLM**:

## Architecture


We propose a novel generalist model, i.e., Video-3D LLM, for 3D scene understanding. By treating 3D scenes as dynamic videos and incorporating 3D position encoding into these representations, our Video-3D LLM aligns video representations with real-world spatial contexts more accurately.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the Video-3D-LLM:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/Video-3D-LLM.git
cd Video-3D-LLM
```

2. Create the conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n video3dllm python=3.10 -y
conda activate video3dllm
pip install --upgrade pip  # Enable PEP 660 support.
pip install -e ".[train]"
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation     # install flash attention
```

## Data Preparation
For data preparation, please refer to this [instruction](scripts/3d/preprocessing/README.md) for detail.

## Training & Inference
### Full-finetuned Training
Our model is **fully fine-tuned** using a combination dataset from five tasks, including ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, SQA3D, ScanQA, Scan2Cap.
The option `frame_sampling_strategy` in `train_multi.sh` should be set to one of the following options: `['uniform', 'mc-ratio90', 'mc-ratio95']`, and the option `frames_upbound` determines the maximum number of frames used during training phase.
```bash
sh scripts/3d/train/train_multi.sh
```

### Evaluation
Evaluate model performance with specified checkpoint and frame sampling strategy.
```bash
# Usage: sh scripts/3d/eval/eval_scan2cap.sh <CKPT_NAME> <SAMPLING_STRATEGY> <MAX_FRAMES>
# Parameters:
#   CKPT_NAME:           Path to model checkpoint for evaluation
#   SAMPLING_STRATEGY:   Frame sampling strategy (options: uniform, ratio90, ratio95)
#     - uniform:         Uniform frame sampling (equally spaced frames)
#     - ratio90:         Adaptive sampling until covering 90% of scene voxels
#     - ratio95:         Adaptive sampling until covering 95% of scene voxels
#   MAX_FRAMES:          Maximum number of frames to use (upper sampling limit)
# Note: Sampling strategies work consistently across tasks. For example:
#   sh scripts/3d/eval/eval_scan2cap.sh $CKPT uniform 32
sh scripts/3d/eval/eval_scan2cap.sh $CKPT_NAME $SAMPLING_STRATEGY $MAX_FRAMES   
```
